if code is already there in the local and not present in the git
Do the following
- `git init`
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m "hi"`

- Now go to git hub and create a repo without readme


- There will be a command called `git remote blah blah`
- `git push`
- copy paste the command generated which looks like `git push --set-upstream origin master`

- From now onwards its just 3 commands
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m "hi"`
- `git push`
